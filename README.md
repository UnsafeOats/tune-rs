# TuneRs

Tune hyperparameters of predictive models using resample methods.  This tends to be much faster than traditional tuning methods like grid or random search without a huge hit to overall model performance.

This will be the Rust implementation of a (horribly programmed) Python library I put together back when I first started to learn Python: https://github.com/UnsafeOats/tuners
